# Java Explained

This project is a repository for code examples covering core Java up to version 21.

It currently consists of the following sections:

## [Documenting Code](./documents/documentingCode.md)

## [Java Explained Tutorials](./documents/tutorials.md)

Tutorials that consist of code examples primarily in the form of tests and test implementations. The tests are written 
using JUnit 5 and are not TDD tests but rather examples of how to use the Java language features.

## [Java Explained Enhancements By Version](./documents/changesByJavaVersion.md)

A list of version changes from Java 8 to the latest version, which is currently version 21.

## [Java Explained Algorithms and Data Structures](./documents/algorithmsAndDataStructures.md)

Implementations of standard algorithms and data structures.

## [Java Explained Design Patterns](./documents/designPatterns.md)

Implementations of standard design patterns.

## [Java Explained Programming Challenges](./documents/problemsAndSolutions.md)

A collection of programming challenges and solutions. There is overlap between problems and solutions in the other sections, 
but the difference is that the problems and solutions are specific applications of algorithms, data structures, 
and design patterns.
