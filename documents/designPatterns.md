# Java Explained: Design Patterns implemented in Java

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

1. **Creational Patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems and add complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling object creation.

   Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns:** These patterns deal with object composition. They describe how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. Structural patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

   Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.

3. **Behavioral Patterns:** These patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

   Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.

Each type of design pattern serves a specific purpose and provides a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
