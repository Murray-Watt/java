# Documenting Code

## Comments

I believe in a pragmatic approach to commenting in code, emphasizing the importance of using meaningful and relevant comments 
rather than excessive or redundant ones. Comments should focus on explaining complex logic, edge cases, or critical functionality 
that may not be easily understood by simply reading the code.

I view tests themselves as a form of documentation, providing valuable insights into the intended behavior and expected 
outcomes of the code. Test-driven development (TDD) not only ensures that code is thoroughly tested but also allows developers 
to gain a better understanding of the codebase through the tests written. In this sense, well-written tests can reduce 
the need for additional comments in the code.

Another point I'd like to highlight is that commented code can be challenging to maintain. As code evolves and changes over time, 
there's a risk that the associated comments might not be updated accordingly, leading to potential discrepancies between 
the code and its documented descriptions. This can cause confusion and increase the time and effort required to maintain 
the codebase effectively.

In conclusion, I advocate for a balanced approach to commenting, where comments are used strategically to enhance 
understanding and complement the documentation provided by well-written tests. This approach avoids unnecessary redundancy 
and makes the codebase more maintainable in the long run.
