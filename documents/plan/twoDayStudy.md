For an additional problem that involves RegEx to advance your skills, consider the following:
Advanced RegEx Problem: URL Validation
Design and implement a function that validates a given URL using regular expressions. The function should check if the URL is well-formed and meets the following criteria:
Scheme (http, https): The URL must start with either "http://" or "https://".
Domain: The URL must contain a valid domain name (e.g., example.com).
Path: The URL may have a path following the domain (e.g., /path/to/resource).
Query Parameters: The URL may include query parameters following the path (e.g., ?param1=value1&param2=value2).
Fragment: The URL may include a fragment identifier at the end (e.g., #section1).
Create a regular expression pattern that captures each of these components and validates the URL structure accordingly. Then, implement a function that takes a URL as input and returns true if the URL is valid and false otherwise.

Complex Iterators Problem: Custom Iterator
Design and implement a custom iterator that traverses a binary tree in level order and returns the nodes one by one. The iterator should support the following operations:
next(): Returns the next node in level order traversal and moves the iterator to the next position.
hasNext(): Returns true if there are more nodes in the level order traversal; false otherwise.
Your task is to implement the custom iterator class and provide methods to perform level order traversal. Make sure to handle edge cases like empty trees and trees with only one node.
For a problem involving streams and groupings, consider the following:
Streams and Grouping Problem: Employee Data Analysis
Given a stream of employee records, write a program that reads the stream, groups the employees by their departments, and calculates the average salary for each department. The input stream contains the following information for each employee:
Employee ID (integer)
Employee name (string)
Department name (string)
Salary (double)
Your program should group employees by their department and calculate the average salary for each department. Print the results in the following format:
Copy
Department: [Department Name]
Average Salary: [Average Salary]
Use Java streams and grouping functionalities to solve this problem efficiently.
