### Easy

Given an array of integers called nums and an integer target, find two distinct indices in the array such 
that the sum of the elements at these indices equals target. You may assume that there is exactly one solution 
for each input."

Constraints:

The length of nums is at least 2 and at most 10,000.
The values of the elements in nums and target are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
There is only one valid pair of indices that satisfies the condition."

Given two strings, order and str, with unique characters in order and str, sort the characters of str so 
that they follow the same order as order. If a character x appears before a character y in order, 
then x should appear before y in the permuted string. Return any permutation of str that meets this condition.'

order and str are strings with only lowercase letters.
order is has distinct characters and is no longer than 26.
