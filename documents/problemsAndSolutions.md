# Java Explained: Problems and Solutions

## Introduction

## Dynamic Programming
### Easy
Calculate minimum cost to climb a staircase where you can take
either 1 or 2 steps at a time and each step has a cost associated with it.

[MinCostPath.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/dynamic/easy/MinCostPath.java)
[MinCostPathTest.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/dynamic/easy/MinCostPathTest.java)

calculate the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase where you can take
either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

[StaircaseClimbingTest.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/dynamic/easy/StaircaseClimbingTest.java)

## Search 
### Easy
Finds two numbers in the given array nums that add up to the target
Returns their indices in an array

Assumes that there will always be exactly one solution

[FindTwoSum.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/search/easy/FindTwoSum.java)
[FindTwoSum.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/search/easy/FindTwoSumTest.java)

## String 
### Easy

[MatchBrackets.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/strings/MatchBrackets.java)
[MatchBracketsTest.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/strings/MatchBracketsTest.java)

A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. 
The lengths should not have leading zeros.

[AbbreviateString.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/strings/easy/Abbreviation.java)

### Medium
Given two strings, order and str, with unique characters in order and str, sort the characters of str so 
that they follow the same order as order. If a character x appears before a character y in order, 
then x should appear before y in the permuted string. Return any permutation of str that meets this condition.

order and str are strings with only lowercase letters.
order has distinct characters and is no longer than 26.

[CustomSortString.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/strings/medium/CustomSortString.java)
[CustomSortStringTest.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/strings/medium/CustomSortStringTest.java)

## Trees

Given a binary tree's root, return a vertical order traversal of its nodes' values, 
where nodes are ordered from top to bottom and from left to right within the same column.

[VerticalOrderTraversal.java](../src/main/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/trees/VerticalOrderTraversal.java)
[VerticalOrderTraversalTest.java](../src/test/java/org/mwatt/algorithms/trees/VerticalOrderTraversalTest.java)
