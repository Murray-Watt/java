# Red Green Refactor

Read Green Refactor is a development process used in Test-Driven Development (TDD) to guide the implementation of new features or improvements, through an iterative cycle.

Here's a brief overview of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

* Red: Write a test that initially fails (red) to demonstrate the desired behavior or improvement.
* Green: Write the simplest code possible to make the test pass (green), ensuring that the code is functionally correct.
* Refactor: Improve the code's quality without changing its external behavior.
