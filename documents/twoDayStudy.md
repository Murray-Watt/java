## Easy Attempt
### Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II (Done)

Given a string, remove all adjacent duplicates of a character, as well as the duplicates of the duplicated characters, recursively until no more duplicates are found.

### Logger Rate Limiter (Done)

## Medium Attempt

### Break a Palindrome (Done)
Given a palindromic string, find the minimum number of characters to change to make it non-palindromic.

### Remove Duplicate Letters (Done)

Given a string, remove all duplicate letters so that each letter appears only once. The order of the remaining letters doesn't matter.

### Decode String
Convert a string that may contain encoded characters, such as "%20" for a space, into its decoded form.

### Count Palindromic Subsequences
Given a string, count the number of palindromic subsequences present within it.

### Word Pattern II
Given a pattern and a string, check if the string matches the given pattern using wildcard characters, bounded repetitions, and more complex word matching.

### LRU Cache
Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache that supports operations like get, put, and delete.

### Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
Given an array of song durations, find the number of pairs of songs whose total duration is divisible by 60.

### LFU Cache
Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache that supports operations like get, put, and delete.

### Design Authentication Manager (Done)
Design a system to manage user authentication for multiple platforms, supporting common authentication flows like OAuth.

## Hard Attempt

### Number of Islands (Done)
Given a 2D grid of non-negative integers, count the number of distinct "islands" or connected regions of non-zero values.

## Medium - Review Solutions Only
### Reorganize String
Given a string, rearrange its characters such that all consonants appear before vowels, followed by digits.

### Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within it.

### Design Circular Queue
Design a circular queue data structure that supports operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

### Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String
Given a string, remove all adjacent duplicates without using extra space.

### Validate IP Address
Write a function to check if a given string is a valid IPv4 address.
