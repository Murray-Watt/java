     * Static binding is a binding that occurs during compile time. It is also called early binding because binding occurs before a program actually runs.
     *     final, static and private methods and variables use static binding and are bonded during compile time.

     * Dynamic binding is a binding that occurs during runtime. It is also called late binding because binding occurs when a program actually runs.
